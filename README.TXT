PROJECT TITLE: POE_Task3

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
The desktop application is now quite useful with the data being stored between runs. But having to always use a desktop computer to run the program is maybe not the most flexible user experience. Instead, create a web application that will allow the user to access their data from any device that has a browser.
